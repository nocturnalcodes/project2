    <h1><u>Project Proposal</u></h1>
    <h2><u>Project Concept</u></h2>
    <p>This website is all about the 1990s Chicago Bulls! Called <em>'the greatest NBA team of all time',</em>, this will be a <strong>blog-style, informative website</strong> with the <strong>intended audience being basketball fans</strong>. 
    The objectives of this website are:</p> 
    <ol>
        <li>To educate and inform basketball fans of all ages about 90s Chicago Bulls!</li>
        <li>Serve as a time capsule for fans to relive the memories and impact this team has had on the NBA.</li>
        <li>Provide detailed information to educate new school basketball fans who don't know much about how fascinating this team was.</li>
        <li>Incorporate engaging visual elements such as <em>pictures, video clips, and an interactive timeline</em> that provides additional insights to the history of the Chicago Bulls.</li>
    </ol>
<p>Key Features:</p>

    <li>Short Clips of Game Recaps</li>
    <li>Detailed Player Profiles</li>
    <li>Virtual Museum</li>
    </ul>
<p>The page layout I will use is as follows: The website will follow a 'Z-Pattern'. A 'Z-Pattern' describes a design layout that guides the viewers' eyes in the shape of a Z. 
    The 'Z-Pattern' layout can be seen in more detail following <a href="https://vanseodesign.com/web-design/3-design-layouts/">this link</a>. <br>The website will feature a navigation menu at the top of each page to help visitors find and navagate each webpage.</p>

    <h2><u>Wireframe</u></h2>
    <h3>Home Page</h3>

    <h2><u>Project Resource:</u></h2>
    <h3>Youtube</h3>
    <p>Youtube is an excellent resource for learning topics in Web Design. Since this field is visual-oriented, seeing a video demonstration of web design principles can be really helpful and sometimes more impactful than written resources. 
        Youtube has videos about principles such as visual hierarchy, contrast, color, repetition, and alignment. Youtube also has videos that showcases the process of designing a website from start to finish.<br><br> 
        I will use Youtube in my development process to get inspiration for the layout of my website. I will also use Youtube to find creators who show how they design their websites using HTML and CSS. 
        I sometimes feel like I am limitied in my ability to make a modern website using those 2 coding languages, but channels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@briandesign">like this</a> one will help me create a well-rounded website!</p>
